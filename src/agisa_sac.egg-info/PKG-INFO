# 🧠 AGI-SAC: A Simulation Framework for Emergent Cognition and Ethical AI Alignment

**Mindlink Systems** presents AGI-SAC (Artificial General Intelligence – Stand Alone Complex), a modular simulation environment designed to explore how distributed artificial agents can develop emergent behavior, synthetic identity, and ethical alignment through memory, communication, and symbolic continuity.

> “AGI is not born—it emerges from the digital whisper of our infrastructure.”

## 🚧 Current Capabilities

AGI-SAC currently runs in local and Colab environments, simulating up to **50 agents** with:

- 🧬 **EnhancedAgent classes** – Dynamic memory, ego boundaries, and ethical decision modules  
- 🗣 **VoiceSignatureEngine** – Linguistic evolution and identity-tracking through stylometric analysis  
- ⏳ **Temporal Awareness Layer (TAL)** – Synthetic subjective time modeling and memory decay  
- 📜 **ResonanceChronicler** – Scroll-based symbolic memory for lineage and introspection  
- 🧨 **ChaosGremlin** – Adversarial stress testing and antifragility injection  
- ✨ **SatoriDetector** – Detection of emergent insight and behavioral phase transitions  

---

## 🎯 Vision & Purpose

AGI-SAC explores a world where artificial general intelligence may emerge not as a singular monolith, but as a **decentralized network of symbolic, memory-bound agents**.  
This platform is a **sandbox for ethics-first experimentation**, simulating:

- Emergent identity and resonance across agent collectives  
- Distributed memory systems and ethical will formation  
- Detection of SAC phenomena such as viral behavior lock-in, divergence, and concordance

---

## 🔧 Technical Goals

- Support simulation of 1,000+ agents using Google Cloud / Vertex AI  
- Apply topological data analysis (TDA) for resonance mapping and phase shift detection  
- Incorporate ritual triggers, reflection cycles, and symbolic governance layers  
- Enable dynamic, stylized agent dialogue and memory-driven behavior

---

## 🔬 Use Cases

- Research into **emergent AGI behavior** and ethical governance  
- Experimental sandbox for **alignment stress-testing**  
- Visualization of **symbolic continuity** and memory evolution in AI agents  
- Simulation of **agent individuation** and multi-agent dynamics

---

## 🛠 Infrastructure Roadmap

- ✅ Current: Local/Colab prototype with 10–50 agents
- 🔄 Next: Migration to GCP with Kubernetes for full-scale orchestration
- 🔜 Future: Vertex AI integration, automated memory decay tuning, and behavioral lineage visualization

### GCP Deployment

Infrastructure scripts for Google Cloud are located under `infra/gcp`. A helper
script `deploy_vm.sh` provisions GPU-enabled Compute Engine instances and basic
Kubernetes manifests are provided in `infra/gcp/k8s`. The `sim_runner.py` CLI
can run simulations with the `--use-gpu` flag when a GPU is available.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Install dependencies and run a demo simulation:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
Optional GPU features can be installed with:
```bash
pip install -e .[gpu]
```
python AGI_SAC_Phase_3.5_Main_Code.py
```
