# GEMINI.md: AI-Generated Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AGI-SAC project, generated by an AI assistant to facilitate understanding and future development.

## Project Overview

**AGI-SAC (Artificial General Intelligence Stand Alone Complex)** is a sophisticated Python-based research framework for simulating and studying emergent collective intelligence in multi-agent systems. The project explores complex phenomena such as emergent cognition, distributed identity, and "Stand Alone Complex" behaviors, where coordinated actions arise without central control.

The project is built on a modern technology stack, including:

*   **Core Logic:** Python 3.10+
*   **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Sentence-Transformers
*   **API & Web:** FastAPI
*   **Data & Networking:** NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Deployment:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Terraform for infrastructure as code.
*   **Documentation:** MkDocs with the Material theme.

The architecture is modular, with distinct layers for orchestration, agents, and analysis. The project is designed for both local and distributed simulations, with a federation server for coordinating multiple nodes. It also includes a chaos engineering toolkit for testing the resilience of the system.

## Building and Running

### Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/topstolenname/agisa_sac.git
cd agisa_sac

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in editable mode with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,docs,all]"
```

### Running Simulations

The project provides a command-line interface (CLI) for running simulations.

```bash
# Run a quick test simulation
agisa-sac run --preset quick_test

# Run a medium-sized simulation with GPU acceleration
agisa-sac run --preset medium --gpu

# Run a simulation with a custom configuration file
agisa-sac run --config examples/configs/config.json
```

### Running Tests

The project uses `pytest` for testing.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=agisa_sac --cov-report=html
```

### Building Documentation

The documentation is built using `mkdocs`.

```bash
# Build the documentation
mkdocs build

# Serve the documentation locally
mkdocs serve
```

## Development Conventions

The project enforces a strict set of development conventions to maintain code quality and consistency.

*   **Code Formatting:** Code is formatted using `black`.
*   **Linting:** `ruff` is used for linting to catch common errors and style issues.
*   **Type Checking:** `mypy` is used for static type checking to ensure type safety.
*   **Pre-commit Hooks:** Pre-commit hooks are configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to automatically run these checks before each commit.

To ensure your contributions meet the project's standards, install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Contribution guidelines are available in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
