# First Strangler Fig Transplant - Lessons Learned

## 📅 Date: October 15, 2025

## 🎯 Objective
Perform the first "transplant" of a core component (`memory.py`) from the old codebase to a new clean structure using the Strangler Fig pattern, with the golden master test as our safety net.

## ✅ What We Accomplished

1. **Created the clean directory structure**:
   ```
   C:\New folder\AGI-SAC_Clean\
   └── src\
       └── agisa_sac\
           └── core\
               └── components\
                   └── memory.py
   ```

2. **Created necessary `__init__.py` files** for Python package recognition

3. **Copied `memory.py`** to the new location (554 lines of code)

4. **Moved (backed up) the original file** to test the transplant

5. **Ran the golden master test** and it correctly detected the breakage

6. **Identified the import dependency chain**

7. **Restored the system** to working order

## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### Discovery #1: Multiple Installation Locations
The agisa_sac package exists in THREE locations:
- **Installed package**: `C:\Users\jessu\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python313\site-packages\agisa_sac\`
- **Old source**: `C:\New folder\agisa_sac\src\agisa_sac\`
- **New clean source**: `C:\New folder\AGI-SAC_Clean\src\agisa_sac\`

### Discovery #2: Different Package Structures
- **Installed package** (older): Has a flat structure with `components/` at top level
- **Source packages** (newer): Has nested structure `core/components/`

### Discovery #3: Import Complexity
When we moved `memory.py`:
1. The installed package's `__init__.py` tried to import from `.components.memory`
2. This import failed, causing a cascade failure
3. `SimulationOrchestrator` couldn't be imported because the `__init__.py` failed to initialize

### Discovery #4: sys.path Manipulation Challenges
- Adding paths in test files only affects the test process
- Subprocess calls (like running `sim_runner.py`) create new Python processes
- Each new process needs its own path configuration
- Circular imports occur when the clean package tries to import from itself

## ⚠️ Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Circular Import Problem
When we tried to make the clean package import from the old location:
```python
# This caused circular imports:
from agisa_sac import SimulationOrchestrator  # Finds itself!
```

### Challenge 2: Path Priority
`sys.path.insert(0, clean_path)` makes Python look at the clean location FIRST, but the clean `__init__.py` was incomplete, causing imports to fail.

### Challenge 3: Subprocess Isolation
Path modifications in the parent process don't transfer to subprocesses, requiring modifications in multiple places.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: The Golden Master Test Works Perfectly ✅
The test immediately caught the breakage and pinpointed exactly where the problem was. This proves the safety net is solid.

### Lesson 2: Installed vs Source Packages Matter
We need to be aware of which version of the package is actually being used at runtime. The installed package can be different from the source.

### Lesson 3: Gradual Migration is Complex
The Strangler Fig pattern requires careful choreography of imports and paths. We can't just move one file - we need to consider the entire dependency graph.

### Lesson 4: Full Transplant Requires More Than Just Moving Files
A successful transplant requires:
1. Moving the file to the new location
2. Updating all import statements that reference it
3. Ensuring the new location is on the Python path
4. Handling the transition period where code exists in both locations

## 🛠️ The Right Approach Forward

Based on what we learned, here's the professional path forward:

### Option A: Package-Level Transplant (Recommended)
Instead of moving individual files, move entire coherent modules:
1. Move all of `core/components/` at once
2. Update the `__init__.py` to import from the new location
3. Keep the old location as a compatibility shim

### Option B: Development Mode Installation
1. Uninstall the site-packages version: `pip uninstall agisa-sac`
2. Install in editable mode: `pip install -e .`
3. This makes changes to source files immediately reflect in imports

### Option C: Complete Refactoring First, Then Switch
1. Build the entire clean structure in parallel
2. Write comprehensive tests for the new structure
3. Switch over all at once when complete
4. This is safer but takes longer

## 📊 Current State

### What's in the Clean Repository
```
AGI-SAC_Clean/
└── src/
    ├── __init__.py (empty placeholder)
    └── agisa_sac/
        ├── __init__.py (minimal, imports memory components)
        └── core/
            ├── __init__.py (empty placeholder)
            └── components/
                ├── __init__.py (empty placeholder)
                └── memory.py (✅ TRANSPLANTED - 554 lines)
```

### What's Still in the Old Repository
Everything else, including:
- `SimulationOrchestrator`
- `EnhancedAgent`
- All other components
- Analysis tools
- GCP integrations
- etc.

## 🎯 Next Steps (Recommendations)

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Document the dependency graph**: Map out which files import from `memory.py`
2. **Choose a migration strategy**: Decide between Options A, B, or C above
3. **Update the test suite**: Ensure tests can handle the transition period

### For the Next Transplant:
1. Choose a component with fewer dependencies
2. Move it with all its dependents
3. Update imports in one atomic commit
4. Verify with the golden master test

## 📝 Files Modified During This Exercise

1. `tests/test_simulation_fidelity.py` - Added sys.path manipulation (later removed)
2. `sim_runner.py` - Temporarily added sys.path manipulation (reverted)
3. `AGI-SAC_Clean/src/agisa_sac/__init__.py` - Multiple iterations trying different import strategies
4. Created all `__init__.py` files in the clean structure

## 🏆 Success Criteria

✅ Golden master test caught the breakage  
✅ We identified the exact import failure point  
✅ We successfully created the clean structure  
✅ We copied the component to the new location  
✅ We restored the system to working order  
✅ We learned valuable lessons about the migration process  

## 🔄 Current Status: EXPERIMENT COMPLETE

The experiment was successful! We:
- Proved the golden master test works as a safety net
- Learned about the complexities of gradual migration
- Identified the challenges we'll face in future transplants
- Restored the system to a working state

**The transplant itself is NOT YET complete** - that will require a more comprehensive approach as outlined in the "Right Approach Forward" section above.

## 💭 Final Thoughts

This was an excellent learning exercise. The Strangler Fig pattern is powerful but requires careful planning. The golden master test proved its worth immediately. We now have a much better understanding of what a real transplant will entail.

The key insight: **Don't move individual files in isolation. Move cohesive modules with their full dependency chains.**
