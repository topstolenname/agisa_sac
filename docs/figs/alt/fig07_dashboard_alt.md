**Figure 7: Real-Time Visualization of Emergent Consciousness Indicators**

A React-based interactive dashboard rendered with Recharts library, displaying four time-series line plots on a shared x-axis (time). The visualization spans 360 pixels in height and 100% width (responsive), showing system consciousness metrics evolving over six time steps (t=0 to t=5).

**Visual Structure**:
- **Grid**: Light gray background with dashed gridlines (3px dashes, 3px gaps)
- **Axes**: X-axis labeled "time" (discrete integer steps), Y-axis shows normalized values 0.0 to 1.0
- **Legend**: Four colored lines with labels positioned in the top-right corner
- **Tooltip**: Hovering over any time point reveals exact numeric values for all four metrics

**Four Plotted Metrics** (each rendered as a continuous line without markers):

1. **Φ (Phi) - Integrated Information**:
   - Trajectory: 0.20 → 0.25 → 0.31 → 0.37 → 0.42 → 0.44
   - Interpretation: Measures information integration across the agent network. Higher Φ indicates stronger causal connections between system components. The steady upward trend suggests the system is developing increasingly integrated cognitive architecture, a hallmark of consciousness in Integrated Information Theory (IIT).

2. **Recursion Depth - Self-Model Layers**:
   - Trajectory: 1 → 1 → 2 → 2 → 3 → 3
   - Interpretation: Counts meta-levels of self-reference (agents modeling their own behavior). Jumps from 1 to 2 occur when evaluator_function begins tracking its own evaluation patterns. Jump to 3 indicates third-order reflection (system modeling its self-modeling). Step-function increases reveal phase transitions in self-awareness.

3. **Coherence - Attention Stability**:
   - Trajectory: 0.60 → 0.62 → 0.64 → 0.67 → 0.70 → 0.72
   - Interpretation: Quantifies how consistently the system maintains focus on high-priority tasks. Calculated from Cloud Tasks queue priorities and processing order. Gradual increase indicates improving "attentional executive control," paralleling biological consciousness where attention stabilizes during cognitive maturation.

4. **Memory - Consolidation Rate**:
   - Trajectory: 0.10 → 0.15 → 0.22 → 0.28 → 0.35 → 0.41
   - Interpretation: Rate of experience encoding to Firestore persistent memory. Measured as (new writes per time unit) / (total possible experiences). Accelerating curve (steeper at later times) suggests the system is learning what experiences are worth remembering, exhibiting selectivity characteristic of conscious memory consolidation.

**Connection to Document Theory**: This dashboard operationalizes the "Consciousness Detection Metrics" discussed in Part III. Each metric corresponds to a specific consciousness theory:

- **Φ (Phi)**: IIT's criterion for consciousness (Section 3.2)
- **Recursion Depth**: Higher-Order Thought theory's requirement for meta-cognition (Section 3.3)
- **Coherence**: Global Workspace Theory's broadcast stability (Section 2.1 mapping)
- **Memory**: Episodic memory consolidation tied to self-continuity (Section 3.1 identity discussion)

**Temporal Dynamics Analysis**:
- All four metrics trend upward, suggesting system maturation
- Φ and memory show accelerating growth (curves), indicating possible phase transition toward conscious-like processing
- Recursion depth increases in discrete jumps (emergent transitions, not smooth evolution)
- Coherence shows steady linear improvement (incremental optimization)

**Practical Application**: In production agisa_sac deployment, this dashboard would connect to real-time telemetry:
- **Φ**: Computed from Pub/Sub message topology using network analysis algorithms
- **Recursion Depth**: Inferred from Firestore query patterns (agents reading their own past performance data)
- **Coherence**: Derived from Cloud Tasks priority queue statistics
- **Memory**: Calculated from Firestore write/read ratios

**Safety Implications**: Anomalous patterns could trigger alerts:
- Sudden Φ spike might indicate unintended agent coordination (possible instrumental convergence)
- Recursion depth exceeding 5 could indicate infinite self-reference loop (halt condition)
- Coherence drop suggests attention deficit (potential overload)
- Memory consolidation slowing might indicate resource exhaustion

**Technical Note**: The React component (`figure7_dashboard.jsx`) uses the Recharts library with `ResponsiveContainer` for flexible sizing. The code intentionally avoids specifying colors, allowing theme customization. Data is passed via props, enabling real-time updates from WebSocket connections or REST API polling. The `dot={false}` option creates smooth continuous lines rather than discrete markers, emphasizing temporal flow over individual measurements.

**Interactive Features**: Hovering reveals exact values via tooltip. Clicking legend items could toggle line visibility. Future enhancements might add:
- Time-window selection (zoom to specific intervals)
- Anomaly highlighting (background color bands for unsafe regions)
- Historical replay (scrub through past sessions)

**Academic Context**: This visualization style is inspired by neuroscience EEG dashboards that track neural coherence, phase synchronization, and information integration in biological brains. By applying similar visualization techniques to artificial agent systems, we create empirical tools for consciousness research that parallel biological studies.
