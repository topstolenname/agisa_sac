# ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Risk: High GPU Cost at Scale
**Mitigation:** Use budget-aware scheduling; explore preemptible VMs

### Risk: Firestore/BigQuery latency at 1,000+ agent concurrency
**Mitigation:** Batch writes, use async pipelines, offload non-critical logs to GCS

### Risk: Scaling symbolic memory complexity
**Mitigation:** Limit temporal depth during stress tests; segment agent clusters
