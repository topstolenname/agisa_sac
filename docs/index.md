# 🌐 AGI-SAC  
**Artificial General Intelligence – Stand Alone Complex**

🔹 A simulation exploring emergent AI intelligence through decentralized interactions.

## 🚀 What is AGI-SAC?

AGI-SAC is a computer simulation designed to study how AI might evolve naturally—without a central controller—by interacting like individuals in a social network.

---

## 🧠 Inspired by Stand Alone Complex

- **Independent AI Agents:** Collaborate, share ideas, and shape their own evolution.
- **Emergent Intelligence:** Patterns emerge as AI agents develop unique identities, ethics, and opinions.
- **Safe AI Research:** A controlled environment to study how AI learns, influences, and coexists.

---

## 🔬 How Does It Work?

AGI-SAC runs a network of AI agents, each with unique:

- ✔️ Personalities & communication styles  
- ✔️ Memories & decision-making processes  
- ✔️ Ability to learn from interactions

👥 Like a digital society, agents influence each other, forming trends, ethics, and knowledge systems—just like viral memes spreading online.

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters

This project explores critical questions:

- ❓ Can AI develop a “culture”?  
- 🤖 How do independent AIs learn ethical behavior?  
- 🌐 Could AI evolve naturally—without direct human control?

By understanding these dynamics, we can better predict AI behavior and design systems that work cooperatively with humans.

## 🔗 Real-World Inspiration

Think about social media:  
No single person makes a meme go viral—it spreads through interactions.

🔄 AGI-SAC simulates this for AI agents, showing how decentralized intelligence can emerge.
