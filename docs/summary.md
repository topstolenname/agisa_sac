# AGI-SAC Landing Summary

This project explores emergent behavior through collections of interacting agents.

The new `MultiAgentSystem` class provides a lightweight way to create and manage
multiple `EnhancedAgent` objects. Each agent has its own memory, cognitive
engine, and voice characteristics. System statistics report how many agents exist
and how many have been created in total.
