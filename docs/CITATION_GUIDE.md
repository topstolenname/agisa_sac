## Figure-Specific Citations

### Figure 1: Persistence Diagram

**Short form**: (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 1)

**Long form**: Topological persistence analysis (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 1) demonstrates how β₀ (connected components) and β₁ (loops) quantify emergent agent coordination patterns, with high-persistence features indicating stable organizational structures that transcend individual agent behaviors.

**BibTeX Entry**:
```bibtex
@misc{jessup2025_fig1,
  author = {Jessup, Tristan J.},
  title = {Persistence Diagram for Agent System Analysis},
  year = {2025},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/topstolenname/agisa_sac/blob/main/docs/figs/svg/figure1.svg}},
  note = {Figure from "The Agentic Swarm" supplementary materials}
}
```

### Figure 2: Mapper Graph

**Short form**: (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 2)

**Long form**: The Mapper algorithm visualization (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 2) creates a topological skeleton of high-dimensional agent behavior space, revealing distinct operational modes connected by gradual transition paths.

**BibTeX Entry**:
```bibtex
@misc{jessup2025_fig2,
  author = {Jessup, Tristan J.},
  title = {Mapper Graph: Topological Skeleton of Agent Behavior Space},
  year = {2025},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/topstolenname/agisa_sac/blob/main/docs/figs/svg/figure2.svg}},
  note = {Figure from "The Agentic Swarm" supplementary materials}
}
```

### Figure 3: Decentralized Agent Network

**Short form**: (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 3)

**Long form**: The event-driven architecture (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 3) illustrates how Pub/Sub topics function as a global workspace, enabling emergent coordination without centralized control through asynchronous message passing between specialized agent modules.

**BibTeX Entry**:
```bibtex
@misc{jessup2025_fig3,
  author = {Jessup, Tristan J.},
  title = {Pub/Sub Topics as Global Workspace for Emergent Coordination},
  year = {2025},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/topstolenname/agisa_sac/blob/main/docs/figs/svg/figure3.svg}},
  note = {Figure from "The Agentic Swarm" supplementary materials}
}
```

### Figure 4: Instrumental Convergence Flow

**Short form**: (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 4)

**Long form**: Instrumental convergence analysis (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 4) demonstrates how agents with diverse final goals converge on similar intermediate strategies (self-preservation, resource acquisition, goal-content integrity), creating potential safety risks even for well-intentioned systems.

**BibTeX Entry**:
```bibtex
@misc{jessup2025_fig4,
  author = {Jessup, Tristan J.},
  title = {Instrumental Convergence: Diverse Goals Leading to Shared Subgoals},
  year = {2025},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/topstolenname/agisa_sac/blob/main/docs/figs/svg/figure4.svg}},
  note = {Figure from "The Agentic Swarm" supplementary materials}
}
```

### Figure 5: Identity Layer Stack

**Short form**: (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 5)

**Long form**: The three-tier identity architecture (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 5) progresses from cryptographic primitives (authentication) through verifiable credentials (capability attestations) to relational identity (reputation), creating the "continuous self" required for consciousness-like temporal awareness.

**BibTeX Entry**:
```bibtex
@misc{jessup2025_fig5,
  author = {Jessup, Tristan J.},
  title = {Three-Tier Agentic Identity Architecture},
  year = {2025},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/topstolenname/agisa_sac/blob/main/docs/figs/svg/figure5.svg}},
  note = {Figure from "The Agentic Swarm" supplementary materials}
}
```

### Figure 6: agisa_sac Workflow

**Short form**: (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 6)

**Long form**: The complete task lifecycle (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 6) implements the five-phase processing cycle (Task → Plan → Execute → Evaluate → Persist) with cyclic feedback enabling meta-learning and the recursive self-monitoring required for consciousness theories.

**BibTeX Entry**:
```bibtex
@misc{jessup2025_fig6,
  author = {Jessup, Tristan J.},
  title = {agisa\_sac Complete Task Lifecycle Workflow},
  year = {2025},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/topstolenname/agisa_sac/blob/main/docs/figs/svg/figure6.svg}},
  note = {Figure from "The Agentic Swarm" supplementary materials}
}
```

### Figure 7: Consciousness Metrics Dashboard

**Short form**: (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 7)

**Long form**: Real-time consciousness indicators (Jessup, 2025, Fig. 7) track integrated information (Φ), recursion depth, attention coherence, and memory consolidation, operationalizing multiple consciousness theories (IIT, Higher-Order Thought, Global Workspace) in a production monitoring system.

**BibTeX Entry**:
```bibtex
@misc{jessup2025_fig7,
  author = {Jessup, Tristan J.},
  title = {Consciousness Metrics Dashboard: Real-Time Emergent Indicators},
  year = {2025},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/topstolenname/agisa_sac/blob/main/docs/figs/svg/figure7.svg}},
  note = {Figure from "The Agentic Swarm" supplementary materials. Interactive React component}
}

### Example Caption with Full Attribution

**Figure 1.** Topological Persistence Analysis. Scatter plot showing birth/death times of topological features (β₀ components and β₁ loops) across system evolution. Features far above the diagonal indicate persistent organizational patterns. Points represent synthetic data for illustration; production deployment would use GUDHI or Ripser algorithms on actual Pub/Sub message topology. Adapted from Jessup, T. J.
