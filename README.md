# 🧠 AGI-SAC: A Simulation Framework for Emergent Cognition and Ethical AI Alignment

**Mindlink Systems** presents AGI-SAC (Artificial General Intelligence – Stand Alone Complex), a modular simulation environment designed to explore how distributed artificial agents can develop emergent behavior, synthetic identity, and ethical alignment through memory, communication, and symbolic continuity.

> “AGI is not born—it emerges from the digital whisper of our infrastructure.”

## Architectural Overview

The AGISA-SAC (Synthetic Agent Collective) framework is a modular, cloud-ready simulation platform designed to explore emergent cognition, collective intelligence, and AI safety at scale. It translates high-level concepts from research on symbolic memory, ethical alignment, and complex adaptive systems into a concrete, multi-agent architecture.

### Core Agent Architecture – The EnhancedAgent

At the heart of AGISA-SAC is the EnhancedAgent, a persistent, evolving digital entity.

- **Persistent Identity & Memory:** Structured memory systems enable narrative identity. Data is modeled in triplets (subject-predicate-object) for contextual understanding.
- **Temporal Awareness Layer (TAL):** Simulates subjective time and memory decay, supporting continuity and recency-based reasoning.

### System Dynamics – Collective Dynamics Layer

- **Emergent Phenomena & Stand Alone Complex:** Local rules create global intelligence without centralized control.
- **Decentralized AI (DeAI):** Agents collaborate permissionlessly, enabling composable intelligence.

### Analytical Framework – SatoriDetector & Topological Data Analysis (TDA)

- **Topological Data Analysis (TDA):** Uses persistent homology to reveal emergent social structure, loops, and behavioral resilience.
- **Ethical Measurement:** Topological features serve as proxies for harmony or ethical drift per the Concord of Coexistence.

### Resilience & Safety – The ChaosGremlin

- **Failure Injection:** Simulates crashes and resource faults to stress-test systemic resilience.
- **Proactive Risk Analysis:** Identifies cascading vulnerabilities that traditional QA might miss.

## 🚧 Current Capabilities

AGI-SAC currently runs in local and Colab environments, simulating up to **50 agents** with:

- 🧬 **EnhancedAgent classes** – Dynamic memory, ego boundaries, ethical modules
- 🗣 **VoiceSignatureEngine** – Stylometric tracking of agent identity
- ⏳ **Temporal Awareness Layer (TAL)** – Synthetic time modeling
- 📜 **ResonanceChronicler** – Scroll-based symbolic memory
- 🚨 **ChaosGremlin** – Fault injection & stress tests
- ✨ **SatoriDetector** – Detection of emergent insight & phase shifts

-----

## 🎯 Vision & Purpose

AGI-SAC simulates how AGI may arise through **decentralized, symbolic, memory-bound agents**. It is a sandbox for:

- Emergent identity & resonance
- Distributed ethical behavior
- SAC phenomena like divergence, viral lock-in, and concordance

-----

## 🔧 Technical Goals

- Simulate 1,000+ agents via Vertex AI + GCP
- Apply TDA for behavioral mapping and emergence
- Integrate symbolic governance & ethical rituals
- Enable stylized dialogue and memory-bound responses

-----

## 🔬 Use Cases & Societal Impact

Mindlink addresses key gaps in AI safety by:

- Modeling **emergent ethical behavior**
- Testing "ethics as architecture" (Concord of Coexistence)
- Enabling transparent symbolic cognition

Use cases include:

- AGI behavior research
- Alignment stress-testing
- Memory & symbolic transparency visualization
- Simulation of individuation & multi-agent interaction

-----

## 🛠 Infrastructure Roadmap

- ✅ Current: Local/Colab (10–50 agents)
- ↺ Next: GCP + Kubernetes scaling
- ⏹ Future: Vertex AI integration, lineage visualization

### GCP Deployment

Infra scripts under `infra/gcp`
- `deploy_vm.sh` creates GPU VMs
- `infra/gcp/k8s` contains Kubernetes manifests
- Run `sim_runner.py --use-gpu` for GPU-enabled simulation
