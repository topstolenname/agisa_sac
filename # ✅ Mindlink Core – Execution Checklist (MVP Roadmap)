> This document outlines the prioritized tasks for the initial proof of concept (PoC), chaos resilience testing, simplified governance implementation, and whitepaper planning for the `mindlink_core` MVP.

---

## 🧪 1. Proof of Concept Build (Simulation Layer)

- [ ] Set up Docker Compose to simulate 100+ node environment
- [ ] Implement `run_simulation()` core loop
  - [ ] CRDT-based memory merge across nodes
  - [ ] CBP (Consensus-Based Proofing) coherence arbitration
- [ ] Capture performance metrics:
  - [ ] Per-node CPU/memory usage
  - [ ] Merge resolution timing
  - [ ] Redundancy reduction / compute savings
  - [ ] CBP arbitration overhead

---

## 🧨 2. Chaos Engineering Test Battery

- [ ] Inject node failures (graceful and sudden crash)
- [ ] Simulate bad actors:
  - [ ] Malicious merge submissions
  - [ ] Nonsensical or contradictory memory vectors
- [ ] Create network partition scenarios:
  - [ ] Isolated nodes
  - [ ] Gossip propagation delay

### Evaluation Targets:
- [ ] CBP quorum stability under stress
- [ ] Observer agent detection of malicious or incoherent behavior
- [ ] Staking/penalty model effectiveness in sandbox

---

## 🔐 3. Privacy & Governance (Simplified for MVP)

- [ ] Implement **gradient clipping** in memory vector deltas
- [ ] Replace semantic similarity with **static rule-based CBP validation**
- [ ] Deploy **minimal observer logic**:
  - [ ] Stateless
  - [ ] Triggered only on merge proposals
  - [ ] No inference or retention

> Note: All traces must remain synthetic. Avoid PII risk even in simulation.

---

## 🌱 4. Phased Community Rollout Strategy

- [ ] Identify early-adopter orgs:
  - [ ] LAION
  - [ ] EleutherAI
  - [ ] HuggingFace forums or ML Collective
- [ ] Build opt-in onboarding doc for external testers
- [ ] Establish public changelog + transparent telemetry
- [ ] Enable anonymous feedback loop or structured form

---

## 📄 5. Whitepaper Drafting

- [ ] Draft sections:
  - [ ] Intro: Project background + AGI-SAC lineage
  - [ ] Architecture: CRDT memory, CBP governance, node design
  - [ ] Ethics: Lightweight observer logic, MVP constraints
  - [ ] Limitations: Coherence vs inference, staking trust bootstrap
- [ ] Write Red Team Appendix:
  - [ ] Threat surface: node compromise, data poisoning, quorum hijack
  - [ ] Response protocol: staking isolation, observer override
  - [ ] Open questions and future mitigation options

## 📌 Notes

- This checklist supports milestone planning, partner previews, and the GitHub README.
- Use subtask tracking under each heading to reflect progress status.
- Can be extended into a full milestone map using project boards or Gantt chart tools.
