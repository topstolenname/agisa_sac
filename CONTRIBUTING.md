# Contributing

## How to contribute
- Create a feature branch for your change.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (and `pip install -e .` if using editable install).
- Preview docs locally with `mkdocs serve` before pushing.
- **Diagrams:** Edit sources in `docs/figs/src/`. SVGs are generated by CI; `docs/figs/svg/` is ignored.

## PR checklist
- [ ] `mkdocs build --strict` passes locally
- [ ] Figures compile or are unaffected
- [ ] Links in `docs/` resolve (no 404s)
- [ ] If touching code: type checks/tests pass (if present)
